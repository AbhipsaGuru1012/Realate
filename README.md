# Realate

##### _real-time real-estate data prediction & analysis_

A roboust application providing support for predicting and detecting land quality & cover, its optimal usage  for building flats or property, its generative model and  optimal paths to electric/water/sewage reserve.

# Features

  - **Land Cover** : Real estate agents find int difficult to predict and  determine the land quality and optimal cover.
  - **Optimal usage** : Optimal usage of land for predicting the maximum number of flats and bunglows possible to fit into a chosen plot.
  - **External supplies** : Finding optimized path for external supplies like electricity, water or sewage reserves.
  - **Generating usages** : To generate usages of the plot based on demands by the real estate agents and  clients.

### Tech-Stack

Realate uses a number of open source projects:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - for front-end UI
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - fast node.js network app framework 
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - a NoSQL database program
* [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - ODM library for data modelling
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - symbolic math library for machine learning applications
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Another powerful library for deep learning usage
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - for computer vision purposes
* [TFjs](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) - for deploying TF ML models in web
* [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) - for integrating PyTorch models into web


### Future Plan

 - Add GANs generated blueprints for construction on land site
 - Dynamic Pricing model for predicting real time price predictions based on demand and availability.
 - Implementing bridge with nearby sources for particular usages of tools.
 - Implementing better Road Segmentation models for better optimal usage functionality.
 - Implementing real-time deployment with added security.
